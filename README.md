# DOTNET CRM

This is an example MacOS application using .NET to create an MacOS application that renders the UI using AppKit and Storyboard/XIB files.

**NOTE**  This solution only works on a Mac since it's a MacOS application.

## Getting Started

Open the solution found in the src folder in Visual Studio for Mac or Rider.  Note VS Code is not supported because it does NOT support XIB or Storyboard files.
